# Patrick Ballantyne - 30DayMapChallenge

Code and Final Map for Day 4 of the #30DayMapChallenge! The theme is **Hexagons**.

## Overview

I made this quick gif here to illustrate changes in mobility around Retail stores prior to and during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the 'core places' and 'weekly patterns' datasets from SafeGraph, which can be accessed here, I aggregated individual store patterns to H3 geometries (hexagons) and have animated a subset of these from the last week of February, to early April.

Code for the map can be found [here](Tidy Code.R)
