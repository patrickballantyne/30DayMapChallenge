# COVID-19 Retail Patterns - #30DayMapChallenge

Code and Final Map for Day 4 of the #30DayMapChallenge! The theme is **Hexagons**

## Overview

I made this quick gif here to illustrate changes in mobility around retail stores prior to and during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the 'core places' and 'weekly patterns' datasets from SafeGraph, which can be accessed [here](https://catalog.safegraph.io/users/sign_in), I aggregated individual store patterns to H3 geometries (hexagons) and have animated a subset of these from the last week of February, to early April.

Code for the map can be found [HERE](Patterns_Hexmap.R)
